The project topic I will use this semester is cognitive mechanisms linking rejection sensitivity to anxiety. I will be looking at data from a baseline enrollment session, lab data, and EMA data.

```{r, include=FALSE}
#Above command hides the output for loading the two packages
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(workflowr)
```

```{r}
data <- read.csv("/Users/peytonmiyares/Downloads/workflowr-peyton/data/powerball.csv")
  summary(data)
```
